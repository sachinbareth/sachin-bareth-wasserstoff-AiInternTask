The \nrespondents cannot therefore claim that the loss of the \ngoods was explosion damage within the meaning of the \nOrdinance so as to bring the case within section 14 and \nat the same time contend that the loss was not \"due \nto or did not in any way arise ont of the explosion\" in \norder to a void the bar under section 18. Both sec\u00ad\ntion 14 and section 18 have in view the physical cause \nfor the loss or damage to property for which compen\u00ad\nsation is claimed and not the cause of action in rela\u00ad\ntion to the person against whom relief is sought."
